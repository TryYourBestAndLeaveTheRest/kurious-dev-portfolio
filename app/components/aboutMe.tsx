                I'm an aspiring Backend Developer with a strong foundation in server-side programming
                and API development. I have hands-on experience with Node.js and am currently learning
                Laravel, along with database technologies like PostgreSQL and MySQL. I'm passionate
                about building robust REST APIs and implementing proper authentication systems.

            <p className="max-w-3xl mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Currently expanding my skills in DevOps practices, I'm learning Docker, exploring
                cloud platforms like AWS, and understanding modern deployment workflows. I enjoy
                solving complex problems, writing clean code, and collaborating with teams to
                build scalable web applications. I'm eager to contribute to real-world projects
                and grow as a backend engineer.
